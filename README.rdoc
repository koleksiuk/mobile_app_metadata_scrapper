== README

I could go with background website scrapping, but it wasn't mentioned in readme to do so (easy to do, worse to integrate with page =)).
Page scrapping limited to 3 pages max.

* Ruby version
2.2.0+

* Dependencies

Postgres - just because I have this as default and didn't want to run rails new again with SQLite :)

* How to setup

* How to run
